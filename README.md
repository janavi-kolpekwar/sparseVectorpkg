The `sparseVectorpkg` provides an efficient S4 implementation of sparse
numeric vectors in R. Instead of storing all elements of a vector, it
records only the non-zero values and their positions, reducing memory
usage and improving computation speed for large, sparse data. The
package includes optimized methods for arithmetic operations,
crossproducts, norms, means, density calculations, and vector
standardization, along with full support for coercion, plotting, and
operator overloading. This package is designed as a lightweight and
easy-to-use foundation for working with sparse numeric data structures
in R.
